The Tour of Italy is my favorite dish to order.
Every time we go to Olive Garden with the family I like to make a fun little event of it.
"pack your bags" I say to my wife "we're going on a tour!"
I grab my passport and head out the door.
We get to the restaurant in 10 minutes flat.
"WOW, Italy is a lot closer to home than I thought!"
When we get to the restaurant I ask the hostess "do I need to speak Italian here?" with a big grin. The hostess giggles and takes us to our table.
When we get seated at the restaurant the waiter takes our order.
"I'll have the tour of Italy" I exclaim. "Do you need to see my passport?" I say slyly. The waitress giggles and says she will bring out the breadsticks and salad soon.
The salad arrives and I get extra cheese on top per usual.
"starting off up north at the snow covered Italian Alps I see!" My wife groans but the waitress gets a giggle out of it.
The main course comes and it's just as beautiful as I remember it.
I grab my fork "Where do I even begin?!"
I take my fork and make airplane noises as I dive my fork down into the Chicken Parmigiana "Milan, you taste magnificent!"
"Next let's see Florence!" I direct my fork toward the signature Fettuccine Alfredo. It's like I can taste the culture without even seeing the city!
"Now for the grand finale, let's head down to Rome!"
My fork gobbles up the Lasagna Classico in seconds.
"Mama Mia! what a trip!"
We get the bill "wow a whole tour of Italy for only $14.99? what a bargain!"
The waitress seems pretty over it at this point but manages to crack a little smile as she takes my credit card. "Didn't even need to crack out the American Express! hah!"
As we leave I wave and exclaim "arrivederci!" to all the staff as we walk out the door.
What a great family restaurant.
